# Surfer

Surfer is a UI Manager Tool that allows you to manage, control and jumpstart your UI flow easily and fast.

It is intended to be a powerful, flexible and modular All-in-One tool to use in every kind of project from mobile to console, from single-player to multiplayer , from hypercasual to JRPG. Designers and artists can easily build the entire UI flow directly from the inspector whereas programmers can use the API to handle or extend the functionality, mechanics and callbacks of Surfer.
